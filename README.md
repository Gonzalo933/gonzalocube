# Gonzalocube

I wanted to learn how to develop and deploy code to an ESP32 chip. I also love LED visualizations, so this is my attempt at creating a [Hypercube](https://hyperspacelight.com/products/hypercube10).

## Roadmap

- Find documentation and resources  
- List the necessary hardware for the project:  
    - ESP32  
    - [Acrylic cube](https://a.co/d/4cuxIaA)  
    - One-way mirror film  
- Gather starting materials:  
    - ESP32 module  
- Learn how to use the ESP32:  
    - Deploy code  
    - Basic LED playground
